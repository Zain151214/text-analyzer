            Apart from counting words and characters, our editor can help you to improve word choice and writing.
            To check word count, simply:-
            Place your cursor into the text box above and start typing. You'll see the number of characters and words increase
            or decrease as you type, delete, and edit them. You can also copy and paste text from another program over into the online editor above. The Auto-Save feature will make sure you won't lose any changes while editing.
            <br><br>
            Knowing the word count of a text can be important. For example, if an author has to write a minimum or maximum amount of words for an article, essay, report, story, book, paper, you name it. WordCounter will help to
            make sure its word count reaches a specific requirement or stays within a certain limit.
